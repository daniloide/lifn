00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:05,438
Freeman: Every single person
who has ever lived

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,275
was created from the genes
of one man and one woman.

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,377
But technology is on the brink

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,581
of rewriting the rules
of procreation.

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:22,022
We could soon make children from
two fathers or from two mothers.

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,291
Babies could grow
outside the womb.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:29,062
We might even create
hybrid people --

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,764
part human, part animal.

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:35,100
Human reproduction,
unchanged for millions of years,

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,404
is about to undergo
a revolution.

11
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:41,074
Will sex become extinct?

12
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:51,985
Space, time, life itself.

13
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,359
The secrets of the cosmos
lie through the wormhole.

17
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,274
Sex is amazing.

18
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,942
Why?

19
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,879
Well, because without sex,
none of us would be here.

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,614
We are all descendants

21
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,784
of the very first human male
and female,

22
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,489
the people the Bible calls
Adam and Eve.

23
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,925
And for almost all
of human history,

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,462
the way we have made babies
has not changed at all.

25
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,033
But a brave new world
of human reproduction

26
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,135
is just around the corner.

27
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,006
New technology
and our evolving biology

28
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,810
are about to rewrite
the future of sex

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,983
and change the age-old roles
of men and women.

30
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,223
When I was in school, I wanted
to try out for the track team,

31
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:08,361
so I thought I'd practice
with a guaranteed win --

32
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,896
against a girl.

33
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,164
On your mark.
Get set.

34
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,166
Go!

35
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,002
Go, go, go, go, go!

36
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:22,541
Well, to my surprise, she won --
by a lot.

37
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,146
In fact, she went on
to become a olympic champion.

38
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,614
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!

39
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,249
Men and women
have always competed

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,919
in the age-old
battle of the sexes.

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,459
What will happen to humanity
if nature picks a winner?

42
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:49,102
For the past half billion years,
nearly all complex life

43
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:53,740
has reproduced through sexual
recombination of their genes.

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,242
Birds do it.

45
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,642
Bees do it.

46
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,379
Even kangaroos do it.

47
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,249
But geneticist Jenny graves
thinks the days

48
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,718
of humans doing it
to make offspring

49
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,421
could be numbered.

50
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:11,157
She's peering into our future
by looking at the sex genes

51
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,225
of these distant cousins.

52
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,827
Dear little thing.

53
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,596
Absolutely gorgeous.

54
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,731
And you can see
it's a little boy.

55
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,100
Yes,
I certainly can.

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,701
Because he's well-endowed.

57
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,003
Well-endowed indeed.

58
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:28,108
Kangaroos don't look
much like humans, but in fact,

59
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,378
they have pretty much
the same set of genes --

60
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,180
about, you know,
20,000 or so genes --

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,682
doing the same jobs.

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,620
Freeman: All living things
are built from genes

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,355
that are made up of DNA.

64
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:48,162
Those genes are coiled up into
clusters called chromosomes.

65
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,331
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

66
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,133
Gender of both humans
and kangaroos

67
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,969
depends on just one pair.

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,839
Girls have two &quot;X&quot; Chromosomes.

69
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,609
Boys have one &quot;X&quot; And one &quot;Y.&quot;

70
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,247
we inherited this scheme
from a common ancestor.

71
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:16,057
Kangaroos are much more like
the ancestral mammal,

72
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,359
and they haven't changed
nearly as much,

73
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,928
so they give us a window
on the past,

74
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,199
and they really tell us a lot
about our own genome.

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,070
Freeman: By looking at the
sex chromosomes of kangaroos,

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,206
Jenny can see
how much our own have changed.

77
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:37,544
She can also plot the future
of our sex chromosomes.

78
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,882
And according to Jenny,
it's bad news.

79
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:44,486
Human males,
like her grandson Felix,

80
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:47,355
are on the road to extinction.

81
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,357
[ Laughs ]

82
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,360
All right.

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,128
Well, I'm gonna build
a chromosome

84
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,430
out of blocks
of genes.

85
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,600
Felix, maybe you can hand me
some more blue blocks.

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,604
Both men and women
carry an &quot;X&quot; Chromosome.

87
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:06,875
In the microscopic world of DNA,
it's a skyscraper,

88
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,279
a tower of around 1,000 genes.

89
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,384
But the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome,
exclusive to men,

90
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:18,887
is more of a run-down shack.

91
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,623
So, this is a female
with two &quot;X&quot; Chromosomes,

92
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:24,125
one from the mother,
one from the father,

93
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,393
and then
this is a male.

94
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,629
He's only got
one &quot;X&quot; Chromosome,

95
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,432
and he's got a much smaller
&quot;Y&quot; Chromosome.

96
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:33,969
It's got
hardly any genes on it.

97
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,373
All female eggs
contain a single &quot;X&quot; Chromosome.

98
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:42,444
Of the billions of sperm cells a
man sends towards a woman's egg,

99
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:46,715
half contain an &quot;X,&quot; The other
half a single, puny &quot;Y.&quot;

100
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,984
when a sperm cell
with an &quot;X&quot; Chromosome

101
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:54,890
gets to the egg first,
the result is a baby girl

102
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,426
with one &quot;X&quot; From mom
and one &quot;X&quot; From dad.

103
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,761
What happens is

104
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:03,331
these two &quot;X&quot; Chromosomes get
together, and they swap bits.

105
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:08,602
For instance, that bit there
swaps with that bit there,

106
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:12,974
and then maybe
this bit swaps with that bit,

107
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,944
and you end up with something
that looks like that.

108
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,780
And this
is really important

109
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,082
because it means
that the &quot;X&quot; Chromosomes

110
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:21,583
can repair themselves.

111
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:26,522
In women, any harmful genetic
mutations on the &quot;X&quot; Chromosome

112
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,923
can be swapped out
with healthy genes

113
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:31,326
before it gets passed
to the next generation.

114
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:36,965
But men have no way
to repair their &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome.

115
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:41,470
There's no second copy
to fall back on.

116
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,174
This &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome
doesn't swap pieces at all,

117
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:47,542
so it just stays
in a little bundle,

118
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:50,479
and this is a bad thing
for the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome

119
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,848
because if there are mistakes
and errors and mutations,

120
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:54,850
that's too bad.

121
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,885
There's no way
of fixing them up.

122
00:06:56,885 --> 00:07:01,189
And eventually what happens
is you actually lose genes.

123
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,159
And then
this little teeny-weeny &quot;Y&quot;

124
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:07,496
is at great risk
of being lost altogether.

125
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,164
And so, in maybe four
or five million years,

126
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,700
there'll be nothing left.

127
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,236
Freeman:
Without a &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome,

128
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:17,505
men would become infertile.

129
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,075
Would the extinction
of humanity follow?

130
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:30,919
Evolutionary biologist
levi morran wants to know

131
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,690
what happens when a species can
no longer sexually reproduce.

132
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,928
He's working out the details
by working out.

133
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:42,163
There are times when I'm
working on a specific project

134
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,332
or something that's really
driving me forward,

135
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:46,234
and running allows me
to really focus in

136
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,370
on everything that
I need to be thinking about.

137
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,105
Freeman:
Levi is chasing an answer

138
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:53,407
to the most fundamental mystery
of sex --

139
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:57,579
why do we
and so many other species do it?

140
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,648
He thinks he can find the answer

141
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:06,054
by closely observing sexual
activity under a microscope.

142
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,891
These microscopic worms,
or nematodes,

143
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:13,028
are known as c. Elegans.

144
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,230
Their sex life
is incredibly simple.

145
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,597
It's actually pretty sad.

146
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,368
Sometimes the males
will basically take their tail,

147
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:23,005
attach it to their head,
think that they are a female,

148
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:25,073
and mate with themselves
for hours on end

149
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:26,975
without realizing it.

150
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,610
Freeman:
Males are simple,

151
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,381
but their female counterparts
have more complex needs.

152
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:38,686
Female c. Elegans
are not exactly female.

153
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,089
They're hermaphrodites.

154
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,294
They can reproduce
by coupling with a male,

155
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:46,995
just like human females do,

156
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:50,264
or they can reproduce
by impregnating their own eggs

157
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,935
with their own sperm.

158
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:58,039
Levi can control the sex drive
of nematode females

159
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,309
by flicking a few switches
in their DNA.

160
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,446
He can make them
always opt for sex

161
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:07,481
or always reproduce
without males.

162
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:10,618
To see
what a difference sex makes,

163
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,655
levi subjects
these hermaphrodites

164
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,725
to the hard forces
of natural selection

165
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:23,898
by making them cross
an ocean...Of disease.

166
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,933
Morran: If you look
at this petri dish here,

167
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:30,839
what you can see is that
this red bacteria up here --

168
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,675
it's highly virulent
to the nematodes.

169
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,777
It's very likely to kill them.

170
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:38,079
And they have to swim
through this bacteria

171
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,048
to get
to their normal food source,

172
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,515
which is at the bottom here.

173
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,852
Freeman: Nematodes
that reproduce without sex

174
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:45,821
endure the plague
for 30 generations

175
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:48,790
but are not able
to develop a defense

176
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,726
against their toxic invaders.

177
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:55,029
Their ranks are decimated.

178
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:58,000
Now, levi sends
another colony of worms

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,967
across the valley of death.

180
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:03,171
This time,
he's genetically engineered them

181
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,306
to reproduce only through sex.

182
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:08,277
Morran: We again
put them on this plate

183
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:12,648
that has the bacterial parasite
and had them crawl across.

184
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:15,149
See if they could survive
exposure to the parasite

185
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,519
and then reproduce
in their normal environment.

186
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,953
And if you look
at the screen here,

187
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:22,424
what you see is a lot of them
survived that exposure.

188
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,860
Freeman:
Levi's experiment shows

189
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,095
that the sex allows a population

190
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,197
to evolve better defenses
against diseases.

191
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:34,635
He believes that over millions
of years of our evolution,

192
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:39,006
sex is what has kept us
from being wiped out by disease.

193
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:42,944
As levi knows
from his sport of running,

194
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:45,681
it's all about staying ahead.

195
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,783
Imagine that I'm a population,
and each step I take forward

196
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:53,587
is a generation
in evolutionary time.

197
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,490
Freeman:
Reproduction without sex

198
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,393
is a lot like
running in a straight line.

199
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:02,797
A species can get from &quot;A&quot;
To &quot;B&quot; Quickly and efficiently,

200
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:06,301
but if you run
in a straight line,

201
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:10,038
a predatory parasite can easily
pick up on your path.

202
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:17,613
Sexual reproduction is like
following a zigzag path.

203
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:21,049
It's slower,
but the mixing of genes

204
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,987
constantly shifts
the species' evolutionary path,

205
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:29,758
making it hard for a parasite
to latch on

206
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:35,464
and giving a species
its best chance to survive.

207
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:40,735
There are all kinds
of pathogen parasites out there

208
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,272
that could potentially
track our populations,

209
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,373
and so if we have
genetic diversity,

210
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:48,643
then it allows a population the
potential to adapt and change

211
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,579
with those parasites.

212
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:55,511
Freeman: Sex has been vital
to our survival.

213
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,648
But sex is bound to change.

214
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:02,083
It can happen in a million years

215
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,853
if the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome
disappears,

216
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:07,622
or it could happen
within the next decade.

217
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,426
This stem-cell researcher
may have a way

218
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:15,197
to let any two people,
regardless of their gender,

219
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:16,465
make a baby.

220
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:22,538
How do you make a baby?

221
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:27,075
Well,
you need to fertilize an egg,

222
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:33,748
a process that always<i> used to</i>
start with boy meets girl.

223
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:36,919
But for the last 30 years,

224
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,824
doctors have also been able to
fertilize an egg in a test tube.

225
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:47,594
But science is about to offer
a radically new way

226
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,932
to make people.

227
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,541
You start with an egg from a man
or a sperm cell from a woman.

228
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:03,829
This cell may change
the future of human sex.

229
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,366
It's a cell
from ordinary human skin.

230
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,536
But fertility expert
Renee reijo pera

231
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,438
of Stanford university

232
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:15,608
is trying to transform it
into a cell

233
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,109
that could create a new human.

234
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,979
For most of human history,
we've thought

235
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:24,483
that as we develop,
we have the cells that we have.

236
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:28,555
If we have skin cells, they're
going to make more skin cells.

237
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,424
In 2007,
there was a major breakthrough.

238
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,058
We can take skin cells,

239
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,996
and we can move them back
to the beginning of life --

240
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,598
the embryonic state.

241
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,834
Freeman: These skin cells
are bioengineered

242
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,070
to become embryonic stem cells,

243
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,406
cells that exist naturally
in a human embryo.

244
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:51,010
They have the power
to turn into any type of cell

245
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,578
in the human body --

246
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:57,817
heart muscle, neurons,
even lung cells.

247
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,556
Other researchers
are trying to use them

248
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:05,958
to repair damaged organs.

249
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,195
But Renee
has a different plan --

250
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:13,831
to sculpt cell types
our bodies normally could not.

251
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:16,468
So, stem cells
are a lot like Clay.

252
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:19,072
They need
to be given instructions

253
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,407
in what cell type
they will differentiate to.

254
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:26,746
They can become any
of 216 different cell types.

255
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,951
Clay is similar in that
if a sculptor takes the Clay,

256
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,619
they can actually
direct the Clay

257
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,124
into any structure
that you want.

258
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:42,462
A stem cell takes directions

259
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:45,297
to become a cell
with a unique job

260
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:49,335
from a myriad of proteins
and other organic chemicals.

261
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:55,007
Renee and her team wanted
to make sperm and egg cells,

262
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,710
so they set to find the specific
chemical instructions

263
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,614
that would make stem cells
develop down that route.

264
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,083
Pera: To make a sperm cell
from stem cells,

265
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,387
what we've done is
we've taken skin cells from men,

266
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:11,390
and we've reprogrammed them
to embryonic cells

267
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,162
and then used bone proteins
to direct the stem cells

268
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,764
down the sperm-cell lineage,

269
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,866
kind of like
starting with a ball of Clay.

270
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:23,702
We start
with a small ball of Clay,

271
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:28,207
and we try to get the cells to
differentiate along a lineage.

272
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,510
Freeman: Renee is halfway
through the process

273
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,481
of activating the instructions
inside the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome

274
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:39,051
of an infertile man's stem cell

275
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:45,324
so that she can craft from it
a healthy, potent sperm cell.

276
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:48,027
But since males
have an &quot;X&quot; Chromosome,

277
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,463
Renee believes
a similar procedure

278
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:53,065
could take
a male patient's stem cell

279
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,767
and turn it into an egg.

280
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,835
Pera:
It is possible that someday,

281
00:15:56,836 --> 00:16:01,206
same-sex couples
could have their own children,

282
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:04,843
especially if the couple
is comprised of two men

283
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:08,414
because then one of the men
could provide the egg

284
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,383
and the other the sperm.

285
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,719
Freeman:
Renee believes that eventually,

286
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:17,855
she could make sperm cells
from a woman's stem cell.

287
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,424
But it's a challenge

288
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:23,395
because it requires importing
sperm-making instructions

289
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,798
from the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome
of a man.

290
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:29,034
It's a little harder
to imagine same-sex couples

291
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,070
that are comprised of two women

292
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,440
being able to have
their own children at this time

293
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,843
just because
of the number of genes

294
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:40,779
that are on the &quot;Y&quot; Chromosome
that are required to make sperm,

295
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:43,315
probably around 50 or 100.

296
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:44,951
It's not impossible,

297
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:50,288
but it's just much less likely
in the next 10 years or so.

298
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,526
Freeman: Thanks to the work
of Renee and her colleagues,

299
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,061
the age-old biology
of sexual reproduction

300
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:59,432
is about to undergo
a momentous change.

301
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,734
With stem-cell reproduction,

302
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,002
any two human beings
could conceive a child

303
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:07,639
regardless of their gender
or age.

304
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,811
But not everyone
thinks it's a good idea.

305
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm always surprised
how many people --

306
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,915
I mean,
I get bad calls about that.

307
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:20,786
People -- they're so worried
about the world being taken over

308
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,789
by people that are now
reproducing in a dish.

309
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,758
I think that our technology
will be wonderful

310
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,260
for infertile couples,

311
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,429
but I think couples
that are well-able

312
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,765
to have children naturally
will continue to do so.

313
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:35,801
Freeman:
Let's say a female sperm

314
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,303
and a male egg
could be created in a lab.

315
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,775
Couples in any combination of
genders could conceive a child.

316
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:47,012
But the fetus would still need
to spend nine months

317
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,114
inside a woman --

318
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:55,087
unless we could grow our young
in an artificial womb.

319
00:17:55,959 --> 00:18:01,297
We all began our lives in the
same place -- a woman's womb.

320
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:06,302
It was nine months of blissful
ignorance for most of us

321
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,671
but not for our mothers.

322
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:14,244
What if women didn't have to
carry the burden of pregnancy?

323
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:21,383
A radical shift in reproduction
is already happening.

324
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:25,755
Marine biologist Nick otway
has just brought

325
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:31,160
living creatures into the world
in an completely new way.

326
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:36,399
We've done something
that was rather strange,

327
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,334
rather abnormal,
and challenging, too,

328
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:42,705
to think about what are
the implications in the future.

329
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,908
Freeman:
Nick has built a machine

330
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,176
that gives birth
to living sharks.

331
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,479
Otway:
We're looking at a gray box,

332
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,014
which is actually
an artificial uterus.

333
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,083
We shorten it to an a.U.,

334
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,952
and we developed this --
designed it --

335
00:18:56,953 --> 00:19:00,289
to actually take embryos out
of a particular species of shark

336
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,825
and see if we can
continue their development

337
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,461
in an artificial environment.

338
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:11,800
Freeman: Nick built his a.U. --
His mechanical womb --

339
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,603
to restore the population

340
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:16,940
of the critically endangered
grey nurse shark.

341
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,810
It was a mission that came
straight from the top levels

342
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,879
of the Australian government.

343
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:25,981
Otway: One minister
actually challenged me

344
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,651
to come up
with a breeding program.

345
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,120
He said,
&quot;Okay, come back in six weeks,

346
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,356
and don't tell me
you can't do it.&quot;

347
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,159
Freeman: Human beings
have just about mastered

348
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,995
keeping adult fish alive
outside of their natural habitat

349
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,398
by engineering aquariums.

350
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:45,900
Chemicals are balanced,
ph levels kept in check,

351
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,373
waste products cleaned out, and
nutrients delivered on schedule.

352
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:55,244
But keeping fish alive
that haven't been born yet

353
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,746
is a whole new challenge.

354
00:19:57,747 --> 00:19:59,015
Otway: The a.U. Is a small aquarium,

355
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,850
and so you got to create
the environment for the embryos.

356
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,851
They're delicate.

357
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:06,054
They have specific requirements,

358
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:08,224
and the mother is not
providing that -- you are.

359
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:10,159
Freeman:
Unlike an adult fish,

360
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,328
the needs
of delicate shark embryos

361
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:16,366
drastically change as they grow.

362
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,735
Otway: Sharks use
a complex uterine fluid

363
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:21,471
early on in development
and subsequent --

364
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,373
three months into development,

365
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,007
they switch
to a seawater environment,

366
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,876
which mum
pumps in the seawater.

367
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,913
So we really do need to
understand that complex fluid --

368
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:34,450
the composition
and how we need to maintain it

369
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,352
in an artificial environment,

370
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:39,054
and that's something
that's not been done before.

371
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:42,692
Freeman: Nick programmed
his artificial uterus

372
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,661
to change its chemistry
from bodily fluid to seawater

373
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,499
in line with a mother shark's
natural rhythm.

374
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:54,270
Experimenting with the severely
endangered grey nurse shark

375
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,571
was too risky,

376
00:20:55,571 --> 00:21:00,410
so Nick calibrated the first run
of his artificial womb

377
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,913
for a more common species --
the wobbegong shark.

378
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:09,519
Otway: Wobbegong sharks
are easily handled in captivity

379
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,688
and easily maintained
in captivity.

380
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,555
We already knew that they had
actually bred in captivity.

381
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,825
All those things meant

382
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:18,327
that we could actually have
a smaller animal

383
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,496
that we could use
as a model species,

384
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,165
and, of course,
it wasn't critically endangered.

385
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:26,502
Freeman:
To grow baby wobbegongs,

386
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,371
Nick harvested the growing
embryos from a pregnant female

387
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,842
and transferred them
to his artificial womb.

388
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:36,945
He kept constant watch
over the tiny unborn pups,

389

precisely managing the
conditions to keep them alive.

390
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:43,485
Otway: I think you become
attached to these guys.

391
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:47,022
They're sort of animals
that you've taken away from mum,

392
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:49,958
and you hope
that nothing detrimental occurs.

393
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:55,031
Freeman: The procedure
was a resounding success.

394
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,498
After 9 weeks,

395
00:21:56,498 --> 00:22:01,470
Nick's lab gave birth to
14 perfectly formed shark pups.

396
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:06,176
Nick believes that what
is possible for sharks today

397
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:09,011
is possible for humans tomorrow.

398
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:14,216
It's all a matter of knowing
how and when a mother's womb

399
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,553
changes
its chemical composition.

in just a few years,
and around the corner,

403

possibly going back further
in the preterm,

00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,707
but even then, I think
there's still ethical questions

407
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,242
one has to ask about it.

grown in a laboratory

409

be the same as an infant
nurtured inside a woman?

410

what shapes the social roles
of male and female primates.

444
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:58,113
De waal: Chimpanzee society
is quite different

445
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,616
in that they have no

But frans knows that chimps are
not our only close relatives.

451
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:19,102
De waal:
I was interested in chimpanzees,

452
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,905
and I worked with them over many
years, and then I saw bonobos.

453
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:25,942
And people called them
pygmy chimps at the time,

454
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,177
and they just considered them
a small kind of chimps,

455
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:30,746
and I saw immediately that
they were totally different --

456
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,613
in their behavior,
in their appearance.

457
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,849
And so I couldn't believe

458
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:35,150
that people had sort of
lumped them together,

They're not

the bonobos have a special way
of relieving the stress.

almost all the time.

There is, of course, a lot
of female-male sex going on.

who eat
a lot of ground vegetation,

and so bonobos seem to have
an easier time in their ecology

501
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,686
than the chimpanzees,

502
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:51,387
and that permits females
to have

503
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:52,722
these effective coalitions

504
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:55,191
because a chimpanzee female
is basically on her own

if she meets a male
most of the time.

506
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:00,230
And so the bonobos
are a more cohesive society.

00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,124
Hmm.

516
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,626
Are we headed for a society

517
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:33,363
that's less like the warring
and male-dominated chimps

518
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:37,501
and more like the free-loving
and egalitarian bonobos...

519
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,403
[ Growling ]

520
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:43,006
...a society where children
are raised by communities,

521
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,809
and when conflicts occur,

522
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:48,279
they are resolved
with free-spirited sex?

523
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,182
De waal: Well, I think
the abundance of food supply

524
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:53,216
makes things easier,

525
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,019
but it doesn't change,
necessarily,

526
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,420
how we respond to each other

527
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,656
and how adults
respond to children

528
00:28:58,656 --> 00:29:01,057
or how adults
respond to each other.

529
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:03,093
Freeman:
Frans believes that,

530
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:07,030
although our environment
does shape our behavior,

531
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,967
it takes many,
many generations to do so.

532
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,502
The behavior
of men and women today

533
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:15,439
harks back
to the environment we lived in

534
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:20,944
tens of thousands of years ago,
when our species first evolved.

535
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:24,214
De waal: Whereas chimpanzees
and bonobos live in the forest,

536
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,883
humans left the forest
and entered the Savannah.

537
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,119
The Savannah
is a very dangerous place

538
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,088
because you cannot
easily escape.

539
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:33,023
There's big lions there
and hyenas,

540
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:36,360
and in the old days, they were
even bigger than they are now,

541
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,897
and so humans needed to have
a different kind of society.

542
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:43,166
The males got involved
in protecting offspring.

543
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:47,037
As a result, you get pair
bonding between male and female,

544
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,973
so you get a nuclear family,

545
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:51,008
and that's very different
from the chimpanzee

546
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:53,277
or the bonobo, where the males
are barely involved.

547
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:56,747
Freeman:
Unlike the great apes,

548
00:29:56,747 --> 00:30:00,717
who assigned all child-rearing
to females,

549
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,653
human beings usually pair up
to raise young.

550
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:07,124
This behavior is deeply rooted
in our brain chemistry.

551
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,492
[ Growling ]

552
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:14,965
Neuroscientists have discovered
that hormones, like oxytocin,

553
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,534
are released inside the brain
when humans interact

554
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:18,901
with their bonded partner.

555
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:25,642
These hormones urge us
to trust each other and bond.

556
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,945
And so, I think
this pair-bonding framework

557
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:30,080
of the human species
is very important,

558
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,182
and it's basically
what sets us apart.

559
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:36,386
Frans believes that this drive
to form our families

560
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:40,123
around a strong bond
between two individuals

561
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:45,128
will not be altered
for thousands of years to come.

562
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:47,831
Technology may change
our food supply,

563
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,134
who's capable of reproduction,
and how their young are born,

564
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:55,005
but frans predicts most of us
will choose to reproduce

565
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:58,641
not through a community
but rather with a partner.

566
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:03,313
After all,
old habits are hard to break.

567
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:08,218
But sexual reproduction
between only two people

568
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:10,387
may eventually
be deemed inferior.

569
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:15,359
This doctor has found a way
to make children healthier

570
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,163
by giving them
three genetic parents.

571
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,137
Sex is the greatest
creative force on the planet.

572
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,606
It mixes the DNA of two people

573
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:32,177
into novel and sometimes
quite remarkable combinations.

574
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:37,283
Without sex, there would be no
Michelangelo, no Michael Jordan.

575
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:39,418
The more you jumble up DNA,

576
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,822
the more creative possibilities
there are.

577
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:44,757
So wouldn't it be better

578
00:31:44,757 --> 00:31:47,961
if we could have
more than two parents?

579
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:55,901
Doug turnbull of newcastle
university is a medical rebel.

580
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:58,804
His team
has invented a procedure

581
00:31:58,804 --> 00:32:02,708
that can only be performed
by breaking the law.

582
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,911
Turnbull:
I think what we're doing --

583
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,980
and I think we've got to
keep this into perspective --

584
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,784
is that we're trying
to prevent serious disease.

585
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:14,187
I don't believe
that it's right and proper

586
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:16,321
to be doing
these sort of techniques

587
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:19,158
unless we're trying
to prevent serious disease,

588
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:23,696
and I think that most scientists
would feel exactly the same way.

589
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:27,800
Freeman: Doug's radical idea
could cure a number of diseases

590
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,270
that occur when our cells
can't get enough power.

591
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,775
Every cell in our body
contains mitochondria.

592
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:39,278
They provide power
by taking material

593
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,083
from the foods we eat and
converting it to organic fuel.

594
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:48,287
But when mitochondria
aren't working properly,

595
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:51,591
our cells can barely function.

596
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,125
Turnbull:
That leads to the diseases

597
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,495
where it affects the central
nervous system, the heart.

598
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:59,965
They can produce epilepsy,
strokes, blindness,

599
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,936
deafness, dementia.

600
00:33:04,503 --> 00:33:08,875
Freeman: Mitochondria have
their own separate DNA,

601
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:13,111
and a child inherits
all his or her mitochondria

602
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:16,215
from the mother's
fertilized egg.

603
00:33:16,215 --> 00:33:20,820
But Doug has discovered
how to eliminate the disease.

604
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,023
He plans to transplant
the embryo's nucleus,

605
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:27,493
where the majority
of the child's DNA is stored,

606
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:32,364
into a new cell
with healthy mitochondria.

607
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:33,966
While the law prevents him

608
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:36,769
from performing
the full procedure in humans,

609
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,507
he often does similar work
in his garden.

610
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:43,643
Turnbull:
If we've got bad soil,

611
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:46,012
then a plant
just simply won't grow.

612
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:49,581
If you've got an egg which has
got unhealthy mitochondria,

613
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:53,419
then what it means is then that
won't grow into a normal child.

614
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,721
It won't grow
into a normal adult.

615
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,456
But if you've managed
to transfer the material

616
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:01,326
from an egg which has got
unhealthy mitochondria

617
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,963
into one which has got
healthy mitochondria,

618
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:07,299
then that should allow a child
to flourish,

619
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,033
and that's the principle.

620
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:12,071
We really want to move
the nuclear genetic material

621
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,540
from something
which is unhealthy

622
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,208
into a situation
where it's healthy.

623
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,111
Freeman: Transplanting a seed
from a pot of bad soil

624
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:22,348
to a pot of healthy soil
is one thing.

625
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:25,650
Transferring the nucleus
of a human embryo cell

626
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,089
into a donor cell requires
the utmost care and precision.

627
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:33,625
If anything goes wrong,
the infant that develops

628
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:37,228
from that embryo
could have severe birth defects.

629
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:41,600
But Doug and his colleagues at
the newcastle fertility clinic

630
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,969
are mastering the process

631
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:48,341
by performing legally permitted
practice runs.

632
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:52,245
Turnbull: So, the eggs
are collected from women

633
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:54,113
who are donating their eggs
for research.

634
00:34:54,113 --> 00:34:57,750
These eggs undergo
an I.V.F. Procedure --

635
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,786
in vitro fertilization.

636
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:03,155
Freeman:
Doug's team takes a donated egg

637
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,157
and removes its nucleus,

638
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:09,295
creating an empty vessel
with healthy mitochondria.

639
00:35:09,295 --> 00:35:13,632
They then transplant the nucleus
of the defective cell

640
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:15,500
into the healthy vessel.

641
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,136
The law prevents them

642
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:20,473
from putting this egg
back inside a mother.

643
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,807
But if they did,

644
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:26,678
that child would be
unlike any other on earth.

645
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:31,116
She or he would have
23,000 nuclear genes

646
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,952
from two parents

647
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:37,757
and 13 mitochondrial genes
from someone else.

648
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:43,596
Genetically speaking, the child
would have three parents.

649
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:45,498
Many of Doug's opponents argue

650
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:48,834
that giving a child
any amount of third-party genes,

651
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:51,102
on matter
what the medical value,

652
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,638
is crossing a line.

653
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:55,240
Turnbull:
It's 23,000 versus 13,

654
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,410
so you can see
it is a tiny contribution.

655
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,678
And if it's preventing disease,

656
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:05,350
surely that's a good thing
rather than a bad thing.

657
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,319
But for some people,
that's unacceptable.

658
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,422
Freeman: Doug and his team
are now involved

659
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:12,158
in a public consultation

660
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:15,294
to change
the u.K. Government's law.

661
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:19,131
If they are permitted
to move forward,

662
00:36:19,131 --> 00:36:23,368
they believe they can eradicate
mitochondrial disease.

663
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:26,605
It is something
which is controversial,

664
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:30,042
and it will be against
some people's religious views,

665
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,442
for example.

666
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:33,979
I think everybody should be
allowed to have their views,

667
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,249
but I personally
have a different view

668
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:38,384
because I look after
these patients,

669
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:40,752
and I see
just what a devastating effect

670
00:36:40,752 --> 00:36:42,554
it has on the family.

671
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:46,092
Freeman: Doug's procedure
could also be the beginning

672
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:48,260
of a new class of medicine,

673
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,265
one where devastating
genetic diseases are subdued

674
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:57,102
by giving children genes from
any number of third parties.

675
00:36:57,102 --> 00:37:00,138
Our children may someday
have one or two parents

676
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:06,645
that raise them and many more
parents that made them.

677
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:08,213
But why stop there?

678
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,717
Why not make children healthier
and stronger

679
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,920
using the best genes
nature has to offer

680
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,690
regardless of which species
they come from?

681
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,739
The sphinx,
the mermaid, spider-man.

682
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,009
Hybrid creatures
are the stuff of legend --

683
00:37:30,009 --> 00:37:31,911
the brainpower of a human

684
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:35,916
married to the physical prowess
of an animal.

685
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:40,955
But such creatures may not
remain mythical for much longer.

686
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:47,726
Randy Lewis is a pioneer.

687
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:48,929
[ Goat bleats ]

688
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:53,266
On this remote farm
in upstate Utah,

689
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:56,503
he's pushing
scientific boundaries

690
00:37:56,503 --> 00:38:00,107
and creating a new form
of agriculture.

691
00:38:00,107 --> 00:38:04,277
But there are those
who say he's playing God.

692
00:38:04,278 --> 00:38:05,612
Well,
I got interested in chemistry

693
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:06,880
when I was in high school,

694
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,315
when a high school teacher
that I had --

695
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:11,217
he allowed us to do some
experiments on the side.

696
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:14,321
So, we were mixing some
different kinds of chemicals

697
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:18,658
and sort of generated a cloud
of steam and smoke

698
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,327
that went clear to the ceiling.

699
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:23,297
He just had a very perplexed
look on his face and said,

700
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:25,232
&quot;We better
get the windows open,&quot;

701
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:27,067
and really never said
another word about it.

702
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,902
Freeman:
Randy got away with it,

703
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:33,807
and today, he embraces
the same fearless spirit.

704
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:39,747
His latest work is boldly mixing
diverse genetic chemicals,

705
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:43,918
starting with the DNA
of this creature.

706
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,154
Lewis: So, this is
a golden orb-weaving spider.

707
00:38:48,154 --> 00:38:50,123
As you can see,
she's very docile.

708
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:52,192
The dragline silk,
which is the silk

709
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:54,293
that you can sort of see
waving up in the air

710
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:57,397
that she drags along
behind herself as her lifeline,

711
00:38:57,397 --> 00:39:00,935
is actually stronger than kevlar
and more elastic than nylon.

712
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:06,106
Freeman: The immense strength
and lightweight nature

713
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:09,610
of spider silk
make it a miracle material.

714
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,514
Its industrial applications
are almost endless.

715
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:17,918
But to date,
no farmer has ever built a ranch

716
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:21,588
with millions of spiders
producing lucrative silk.

717
00:39:22,556 --> 00:39:24,456
Lewis:
So, there are two real problems

718
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:25,726
in trying to farm spiders.

719
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:26,893
First is they're territorial,

720
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:28,395
and second,
they're cannibalistic.

721
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:29,862
So, when you put
a bunch of them together,

722
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:31,565
what happens is they just start
killing each other.

723
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:38,404
Freeman:
But ever the chemical tinkerer,

724
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:42,509
Randy realized he didn't need
spiders to produce spider silk.

725
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:45,411
All he needed
were the genetic chemicals

726
00:39:45,412 --> 00:39:48,482
that give spiders
their web-making ability.

727
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:51,585
Lewis: What we've done
is identify the genes

728
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:54,654
that make up
each of the different proteins

729
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:57,623
for the six different silks
that the spider makes,

730
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:00,527
and we've been able
to take those and clone them,

731
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:03,830
and then we can simply transfer
them to another organism.

732
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,333
[ Goat bleats ]

733
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:10,671
Freeman: Randy's lab
transfers these spider genes

734
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:14,173
into the DNA
of fertilized goat eggs.

735
00:40:14,173 --> 00:40:16,242
The goats grow to term

736
00:40:16,242 --> 00:40:21,014
and are born with all the genes
that a goat should have,

737
00:40:21,014 --> 00:40:23,316
plus a little something extra.

738
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:27,954
We've spliced a spider-silk gene
into the genome of the goat,

739
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,590
and we've put it in
in a situation

740
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,959
where the only time that
that gene is used

741
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,295
to make protein is when
the goat's producing milk.

742
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:40,233
Freeman:
Randy milks his spider goats

743
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:42,970
and takes their milk
back to his lab,

744
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,706
where it is processed
and filtered.

745
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:50,777
And from one milking alone,

746
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:56,249
Randy yields about 35 Miles
of spider-goat silk.

747
00:40:56,249 --> 00:41:01,254
His work could lead
to a new industrial revolution

748
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:03,323
where groundbreaking
biological materials

749
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:09,129
are produced by animals with
genes from different species.

750
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:11,298
The DNA is the same
in all organisms,

751
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,334
so, if you take a piece of DNA
from any other organism,

752
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:17,003
in general, if you put it
in the right context,

753
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:18,338
it's gonna be produced.

754
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:22,176
Freeman: Randy's work
is also proof of the concept

755
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,878
that animal genes
could be spliced into human DNA.

756
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:30,784
I think that one
could imagine a situation

757
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:32,753
where you could take
the spider-silk gene

758
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,587
and put it under
some kind of control

759
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:36,022
where a human could produce it.

760
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:39,058
Freeman:
These breakthroughs could lead

761
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:42,295
to a remarkable new evolution
of humanity.

762
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:45,032
Today,
we give our offspring the gifts

763
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:47,534
of our best genetic traits,

764
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:50,436
and tomorrow,
we could give them the very best

765
00:41:50,437 --> 00:41:52,505
of everything
nature has to offer.

766
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:57,377
Our grandchildren
could climb like geckos,

767
00:41:57,377 --> 00:42:00,480
run like cheetahs...

&quot;Sex is part of nature.

00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:11,892
I go along with nature.&quot;

772
00:42:11,892 --> 00:42:15,629

[ Chuckles ]

774
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,199
Sex may always be
part of nature,

775
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,705
but only for recreation,
not necessarily for procreation.

776
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:28,275
A world where babies
are chemically crafted

777
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:33,947
and carefully reared in labs
may sound utterly alien,

778
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:38,852
but parents will always do
what's best for their children.

779
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:42,756
That aspect of our nature
will never change.
