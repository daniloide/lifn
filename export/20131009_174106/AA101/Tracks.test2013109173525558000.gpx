<i> Big boy, this is little boy.</i>

<i>How'd things go down

00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:44,213
Weigh-station inspector needs
to learn some adult words

9
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:47,483
and a bit of hygiene,
but he waved us through.

10
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:51,052
The cargo is secure.
Looks like a clean shot from here.

11
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,089
<i>Roger that. Little girl will
take point on your front door.</i>

12
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:56,725
See you at the drop
stop, Mack. I'm clear.

13
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:15,843
Son of a bitch.

14
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:23,215
- You see that?
- Little girl is down.

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,550
<i>Repeat, escort two is down.</i>

16
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,753
I know, Sherlock.
What the hell hit us?

17
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,663
We need to go to alt two, alt two.

18
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,464
<i>Nothing over our shoulder.
Back door's clear.</i>

19
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,566
<i>Protect the cargo at all costs.</i>

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,735
S.H.I.E.L.D. region CT,
this is Agent Mack.

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,972
We are under attack from
an unseen I-don't-know-what.

22
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,014
<i>Agent Mack,
advised identify the threat, over.</i>

23
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,943
What in the holy name of...

24
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,253
S.H.I.E.L.D. region CT ...

25
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:05,355
oh, hell, I can't explain.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,792
<i>Oh, no!</i>

27
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:49,496
Are we there yet?

29
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,493
You know you're late.

30
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,529
I'm tired from the morning's workout.

31
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,766
I thought I was joining S.H.I.E.L.D.,
not 24 hour fitness.

32
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:13,070
It's called relative strength training,
starting with the basics.

33
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:17,439
And next time, you do 15 push-ups
for every minute you're late.

34
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:20,542
Fine, Mr. Fun machine.
Better than pull-ups.

35
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,378
I don't ever want to do
another pull-up again.

36
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,381
You find yourself hanging off the
edge of a building 20 stories up,

37
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,117
you're gonna want to do at least one.

38
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,754
Stand here.
Jab cross, like this.

39
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,391
10 minutes.
You know the hardest part about boxing?

40
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,193
Getting punched in the face?

41
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:42,430
- Keeping your hands up.
- Why do I even have to do this?

42
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,432
I'm sure Fitz-Simmons'
supervising officer

43
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,434
didn't make them do this
muscle stuff.

44
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:52,305
You said you wanted to be
a field Agent, like Coulson.

45
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,307
Well, if you'd like to
switch disciplines...

46
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,575
Hey, Simmons.

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,078
What did your S.O. give
you guys for morning drills?

48
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,479
Oh, atomistic attribute drills.

49
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:02,982
<i>Yeah, we'd name the mechanical,
chemical, thermal ...</i>

50
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:06,619
- Electrical properties of materials.
- Okay, okay. They made your point.

51
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:11,024
There will come a moment
when you have to commit to this or bail.

52
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:15,128
Every field Agent has a defining moment.
Ask Coulson.

53
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,496
When you have to make the hard call

54
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:21,767
to either dedicate yourself to this
or to curl up in a ball and run.

55
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:24,569
How can you run if you're
curled up in a ball?

56
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:29,107
It's my job as your S.O. to make
sure you don't die before then.

57
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,108
Come on.

58
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:32,978
So what was yours, Agent Ward?

59
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,780
- 10 minutes.
- Your defining moment?

60
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,284
Come on, tell me. I want to know.

61
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:43,453
I could get Coulson to give
you some of that truth serum.

62
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:46,256
You could spill your little
heart out to me again.

63
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,526
You mean my level one overshare

64
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:53,429
that miraculously got you to cooperate?

65
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,966
I hate to tell you this, rookie,
but we don't have a truth serum.

66
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,103
<i>Changing course, briefing in three.</i>

67
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:02,806
Ah, looks like we're on the move.

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,308
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 with new orders.</i>

69
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:08,877
Set for Colorado air field North.

70
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,214
A few minutes ago, a S.H.I.E.L.D.
transport was attacked

71
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:16,518
while carrying a priority red protected
asset off route 76 near Sterling.

72
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:18,220
Priority red?

73
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,123
The asset was Canadian
physicist Dr. Franklin Hall,

74
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:22,357
known for his work ...

75
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,759
- Oh, no, not Frank.
- Dr. Hall?

76
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:26,694
He was our chemical kinetics
adviser our second year.

77
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,731
<i>Yeah, he's so enthusiastic about
science, we just adored him.</i>

78
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:32,967
- We can rescue him, can't we?
- He's one of ours. We're gonna try.

79
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,170
- And the attackers?
- Invisible.

80
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:40,373
Wait, invisible?
Cool.

81
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,211
But terrible.

82
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:46,412
<i>Dr. Hall was an asset?</i>

83
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,449
<i>One of a few select scientists
S.H.I.E.L.D. has been protecting,</i>

84
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,718
<i>people our enemies would
love to get their hands on.</i>

85
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:53,954
We keep them hidden,
keep them on the move.

86
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,488
Which is why Fitz and I
were so lucky to have him.

87
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,558
- We don't have him anymore.
- And what does priority red mean?

88
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,829
It means security should have been...
heavy.

89
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:08,500
It was pretty damn scary, and
I don't spook easily, boss.

90
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,535
- Nothing in the air from above?
- Nothing over our shoulder,

91
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,874
<i>but what's scary is they knew our route.</i>

92
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,441
They were waiting for us.

93
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,111
Are you saying they were working
with somebody inside S.H.I.E.L.D.?

94
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,249
Sorry to say... it had to be.

95
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,986
- Fitz, what am I seeing here?
- Well, I'm not wearing

96
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,158
the full-spectrum goggles I
designed, so... no clue.

97
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,460
Let me have a look. Come on.

98
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,863
No, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! Don't move.

99
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,031
<i>Wait a second.</i>

100
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,467
What the hell?

101
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:50,773
I think the electro-static field
scanner activated some...thing.

102
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:57,546
Okay, can we deactivate it? Now?

103
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,315
- Have to increase the density.
- I tried, Fitz, but ...

104
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:01,850
Fitz!

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,486
Whoa.

106
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,362
That did all this.

107
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,966
What is that?

108
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:24,104
Something big.

109
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,301
Either someone cracked our comm system,

110
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,271
or Dr. Hall's movements
leaked from inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

111
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,705
You really think we have a mole?

112
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,508
I think you should go through the
communication logs, rule it out.

113
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,943
We'll work the tractor tread
that we found on the scene.

114
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:54,115
I can do that instead of pull-ups.
I can upload an image of

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,147
the tread pattern, check to
see if there's any sort of ...

116
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:59,318
Already done.
Matched it to a 2010 model.

117
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:01,687
Found a list of purchasers
within a 500-mile radius,

118
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,989
<i>narrowed down to those with
priors, financial troubles,</i>

119
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,324
<i>or propensity for risk-taking.</i>

120
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,958
Three suspects.

121
00:08:06,993 --> 00:08:08,793
<i>Who may have sold
their construction equipment</i>

122
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,828
to the kidnappers.
We'll ask.

123
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,099
Hey, so, Ward said a funny thing.

124
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:18,002
He said that you guys
don't have a truth serum.

125
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:21,372
- Did he? Ward said that?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,973
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:26,710
Hey, wait ... hey.

128
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:30,013
Do you want me to bench press this?

129
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,617
Read it.
Every communication out of HQ

130
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,886
since they decided to transfer Dr. Hall.

131
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:40,290
Hang in there, Doc.
It's gonna be a while.

132
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,368
- Excuse me.
- Who the hell are you?

133
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:55,671
A concerned citizen who
happens to be a member

134
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:59,208
of a giant bureaucratic organization
that's tracking your every move.

135
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:02,244
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Of course not,

136
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:04,913
but you sold your excavator
to some people who did.

137
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:07,482
And you're hiding out
here until things cool down

138
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:09,251
because you know it.

139
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:11,453
I just want to know who paid you.

140
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:16,123
Paid me enough not to answer
any questions like that.

141
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:24,565
- Feels like the old west.
- They gave me money for my equipment.

142
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:28,101
That's all. I never saw a face.
I never heard a name.

143
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:32,339
- And how did you receive this money?
- They write you a check?

144
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:45,450
Paid you in gold?
Now it really feels like the old west.

145
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,354
<i>It looks like this
because it's a doré bar.</i>

146
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:52,124
It means it was made at the
mine rather than in a refinery.

147
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,460
It's only about 92% pure.
The cowboy got cheated a bit.

148
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,729
Can you determine the mine
based on the impurities?

149
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,831
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've done that already.

150
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,534
It's from the Dacey mine in Tanzania,

151
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,537
- which is owned by ...
- Quinn Worldwide.

152
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:10,508
I'm sure you studied the C.E.O.
in your chemical engineering classes

153
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:16,079
or saw him on the cover
of Forbes ... Ian Quinn.

154
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,151
<i>We can't just pluck it from
the ground like a potato.</i>

155
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:24,087
<i>It needs to be extracted
from the ore and enriched.</i>

156
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,255
<i>I know.</i>

157
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,691
<i>You know, tell him this investment
paid for that ridiculous yacht of his</i>

158
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:32,061
and that he'll thank me at
the shareholders meeting.

159
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:38,567
- Why is he tied up?
- Quinn.

160
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:42,271
Does he look like a threat?

161
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,391
<i>I'm sorry about these guys.</i>

162
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:55,016
Welcome to Malta, Frank.

163
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,321
You know, it's one thing to steal
my ideas, Ian, but stealing me?

164
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,457
First of all, I never stole your ideas.

165
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,959
We've always agreed
information should be free.

166
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:06,761
It's amazing how much money
you made off free information.

167
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,996
Secondly, think of this
as a rescue mission, Frank.

168
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,866
In fact, in a moment, I
think you'll be thanking me.

169
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,170
My staff intercepted a communication
about the movement of a certain asset,

170
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:18,922
and when I deduced that asset was you,

171
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:21,641
I couldn't pass up on the opportunity.

172
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:24,644
It's a little out of
my comfort zone, sure.

173
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:28,849
Malta.
You're not stupid.

174
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:32,719
- S.H.I.E.L.D. can't come after you here.
- Not just S.H.I.E.L.D.

175
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:35,922
I am now a naturalized
citizen of this fair country.

176
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:38,323
Stunning beaches, beautiful tax laws,

177
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,859
and a deep-seated hatred

178
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:41,527
of outside forces
telling them what to do.

179
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:42,995
Sounds like your dating profile.

180
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,097
Right.

181
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,398
I moved my entire operation down here.

182
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:49,635
Bought the old prime minister's estate.
It's not really my style,

183
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:53,004
<i>but it had this huge underground
facility, so I figured, hey.</i>

184
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:56,291
Always been a stubborn
bastard. Now you've finally

185
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,544
found a place where the
watchdogs can't touch you.

186
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,481
Not without breaking international law.

187
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,516
Ahh.

188
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,886
But more importantly, old friend,
they can't touch you.

189
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,860
Recognize the design?

190
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,999
We were barely old enough to drink
when you sketched the blueprint.

191
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,667
That's just a miniature prototype.

192
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,905
A theoretical machine powered
by a theoretical substance.

193
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:32,942
Frank, you were right.

194
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:37,013
- You found it?
- Gravitonium.

195
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,515
It's an extremely rare
high-atomic numbered element.

196
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,316
<i>That powers the device.
It's so extremely rare</i>

197
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,052
<i>that most people didn't
believe it existed,</i>

198
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,387
<i>much less the theory that an
isolated positive charge ...</i>

199
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:50,291
- Would turn the flow from isotropic ...
- Guys, high-school dropout here.

200
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,694
<i>How does the device work again?</i>

201
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:56,397
Well, Gravitonium distorts
gravity fields within itself,

202
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:59,600
causing an undulating,
amorphous shape.

203
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,970
Which causes these, um...
wiggly bits here,

204
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:07,007
but when an electric current is applied,

205
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:14,080
the Gravitonium solidifies.
And those gravity fields erupt,

206
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:16,282
<i>randomly changing the
rules of gravity around it.</i>

207
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,751
Well, so, now you can imagine
what would happen to a big rig

208
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:20,352
at 100 kilometers per hour.

209
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:24,356
Or, uh, well, you could just remember,
'cause we saw it already, didn't we?

210
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,359
Yeah, and guess which
genius published every theory

211
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,328
about Gravitonium and possible
applications ... years go?

212
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:32,330
- Dr. Franklin Hall.
- Correct.

213
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:35,067
And Dr. Hall attended the
University of Cambridge

214
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,935
at the same time as Ian Quinn.

215
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,572
Coulson may be off on this.
Quinn is a notoriously good guy.

216
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:43,374
His charity endowment's
something like $8 billion.

217
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:47,111
Yes, with money made from leeching
the earth of its resources.

218
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:49,013
Looks like he's dug up another.

219
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:54,785
20 years, 12 mines, 6 continents,
but, yes, I finally found it.

220
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,355
And now...
we get to play with it.

221
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,793
Do you remember in all
our talks on Orchard Street

222
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:07,330
the part where it's
very, very dangerous?

223
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:09,332
Everything powerful is dangerous.

224
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,969
But I'm not gonna convince
you with more talk ...

225
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:18,040
talk of 50% shares, talk of
Nobel prizes. No, not you.

226
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:22,011
You... will just have to see it.

227
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,517
<i>I built a full-size generator,</i>

228
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:32,687
but I need you to tell me how
to control the gravity fields.

229
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,289
You can complete your life's work.

230
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:39,360
I plan to do this with or without you,
but I know you.

231
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:41,863
I know you'd want it done right.

232
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,334
Now's the moment when you thank me.

233
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,403
<i> The man's a prisoner,
and it's up to us to get him out.</i>

234
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,573
<i>We've checked the specs.
There's no way into Quinn's compound</i>

235
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,842
<i>without a large S.H.I.E.L.D.
strike force or a man inside.</i>

236
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:58,811
He's got neodymium laser
fencing surrounding the property.

237
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,780
They'll never allow a
strike force into Malta.

238
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:02,114
Plus, this weekend,

239
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,416
<i>Quinn worldwide's got its
annual shareholders gathering.</i>

240
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,154
- We're risk global outrage, but ...
- If we go in alone ...

241
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,722
S.H.I.E.L.D. can disavow
us, claim ignorance.

242
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:12,157
<i>Without a man inside, it's impossible,</i>

243
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:14,392
unless you're immune to
pulse laser emissions.

244
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:17,562
- If we had a monkey, we could get in.
- Ugh, Fitz!

245
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:19,864
If we had a small monkey,
he could slip through the sensors

246
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,767
and disable the fence's power source
with his adorable little hands.

247
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,704
- I could go in.
- Drop me in the hills outside of Valletta.

248
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,438
I'll spend a few weeks establishing
a cover, gathering intel ...

249
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:29,606
Hall doesn't have a few weeks.

250
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,075
And to restate, any
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

251
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:33,110
caught on Maltese soil can be
shot to death with bullets ...

252
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,186
- Yeah.
- Legally.

253
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:38,082
- Not me. I could go in.
- Skye, this is serious.

254
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,684
Wait.
What are you saying?

255
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,120
<i>Well, I'm not an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,</i>

256
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:45,554
so I can go in without
breaking all these stupid rules.

257
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:46,889
International laws.

258
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,958
This isn't something the
Rising Tide can hack, Skye.

259
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:51,694
Did you hear the deadly lasers part?
Without a brave monkey ...

260
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,562
You said you could go
in with a man inside.

261
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:54,764
And you want to be that man?

262
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:57,533
Fitz-Simmons loved the
guy, and he needs help.

263
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,803
They could be torturing him, or
worse, making him do strength-training.

264
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,372
But you don't have the
background or clearance

265
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:07,475
or experience with any of this.

266
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:10,545
I know. But I've got an invitation.

267
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,883
Well, technically, it's an e-vite.

268
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:31,660
I understand your concern, but
we don't have a lot of options.

269
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:32,995
Hey, I'm impressed.

270
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,496
She just wrangled an
invitation on her phone

271
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,065
using insider back-channel
voodoo in minutes.

272
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,568
<i>But sending her in with no training,
you're taking a huge risk.</i>

273
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:45,239
I know Director Fury felt he owed you
after you sacrificed yourself.

274
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:46,540
And my card collection.

275
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:50,209
He gave you some autonomy,
but Skye on a covert op?

276
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,145
Are you worried about
her safety or her loyalty?

277
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,348
Both. The Rising Tide is
the reason she got an invite.

278
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:57,250
Who knows how many
protocols she violated?

279
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,385
That's her job ... ignore protocol,

280
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,855
find connections and back
doors that nobody else can see.

281
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,524
<i>Something else is bothering you.</i>

282
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,527
She's holding back, sir.

283
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,664
She says she wants to be an
Agent, but she won't commit.

284
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,900
- She doesn't listen, makes jokes.
- Were you hard on her?

285
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,636
Sure.
I tried playing nice, too.

286
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,204
I need a new strategy.

287
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:23,007
Try no strategy.

288
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,977
Stop thinking like an operative,
start thinking like a person.

289
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,046
Maybe Skye will let
that person help her.

290
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,616
- Help her what?
- Help her think like an operative.

291
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,354
Now, again, slowly, what's first?

292
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,092
- And then?
- Then things are moving too quickly.

293
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:43,660
I'm a proper southern girl.

294
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,862
You'll make me untidy.

295
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,398
<i>Twist the thumb, palm the barrel.</i>

296
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,836
You're gonna die and leave us
hanging out to dry, you know that?

297
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,805
- You're going in with no self-defense skills ...
- I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

298
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,709
You need muscle memory, fundamentals,
the tools to turn yourself ...

299
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,544
- Into a whole bag of tools?
- How did you learn computer science

300
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,146
without committing yourself to it?

301
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:05,414
C.S. comes naturally to me.

302
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:07,416
I'm sorry I'm not
naturally whatever you are.

303
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,884
You think this came naturally?

304
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,088
I had a brother who beat
the crap out of me ...

305
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:15,957
me and my little
brother ... for nothing,

306
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,827
for eating a piece of his birthday cake.

307
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,830
I had to learn to protect us

308
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:25,733
the way I am trying to protect you.

309
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:31,471
That was my moment.
You asked.

310
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:36,777
Sorry.
I didn't mean to push.

311
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:41,781
But I did manage to take this.

312
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:45,384
Getting the gun is one thing.

313
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:49,956
Pulling the trigger ... that is another.

314
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,259
Now, again, slowly, what's first?

315
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,875
<i>Skye will walk in the front door.</i>

316
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,120
The only external
access point to Quinn's

317
00:18:58,121 --> 00:19:00,331
underground facility
is from a beach cove.

318
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,701
<i>A two-man extraction team could
slip in there, but it's not easy.</i>

319
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,738
- Fitz-Simmons.
- The perimeter is surrounded

320
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,407
by a 20-foot-high
neodymium laser grid.

321
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,343
- Touch it and you're toast.
- Dead toast.

322
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:14,311
The only way to disable the grid

323
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,881
is to crack the system
and trigger a reboot.

324
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,983
This would give the team
three seconds to cross.

325
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,435
<i>Of course, Quinn's too smart
to allow any wireless</i>

326
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,821
- access on his property.
- That's where I come in.

327
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:26,290
Yes, working compact
... holds up under x-ray.

328
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:29,626
Desert rose to match your complexion.
But ... oh, what's this?

329
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:33,548
A readout, okay? Turns
green if you're in close

330
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,999
enough proximity to a computer
to gain wireless access.

331
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,234
When it does,
you just drop this nearby and walk out.

332
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:40,636
We'll do the rest. Easy as pie.

333
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,339
Or it will be
if you stick to the plan.

334
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:44,640
<i>Got it.</i>

335
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:48,610
Plan, green, drop, walk... pie.

336
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,147
I don't want to question
your orders, sir.

337
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:53,448
Good.

338
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:57,955
But I've already seen far more
combat than I bargained for.

339
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,521
This two-man extraction team?

340
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,056
It's exactly the kind of
action I was hoping to avoid.

341
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,657
That's why you're not on it.

342
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:06,727
Specialist work is different
from field work, believe me.

343
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:10,331
- When was the last time you ...
- Hall's one of ours, and he's in trouble.

344
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:14,368
I need two men to get him out.
Ward makes one.

345
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,307
So that's why I'm going in.

346
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,244
You forget ... I saw plenty
of action with the Avengers.

347
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,199
- And you died.
- All right, team, suit up.

348
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,016
Thank you.

349
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,414
<i>Hors d'oeuvre, madame?</i>

350
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,149
<i>Who are you?</i>

351
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:09,486
Oh, apologies for his manners.
He knows very little English.

352
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,455
Oh, that, uh, that's...
what...  whatever.

353
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,456
Skye.

354
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,159
- Qasim Zaghlul.
- Big fan.

355
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,062
You built half of Dubai,
including the Arabian blade.

356
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,799
I love that building.
It's super sci-fi.

357
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,233
Where's your wife...

358
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:26,636
- Wife's name's Nadrah.
- ...Nadrah?

359
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,937
<i>Twin sons.</i>

360
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,638
She staying at home with the boys?

361
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:31,106
How's she doing?

362
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,107
- She's good.
- She's good.

363
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,142
The pleasure is mine.

364
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:38,398
I could get used to this, people.
It's like siri if it worked.

365
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,449
<i>Really, the best thing
about your deal is...</i>

366
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,918
Skipper to Bravo.
I got eyes on top dog.

367
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,852
The Eagle is landing on it.

368
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,923
- What are you doing?
- Uh, sorry, I ... I don't know.

369
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:51,125
I see Quinn.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

370
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,262
<i>I mean, that and its effect
on the industrial average.</i>

371
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:56,898
<i>That was good.</i>

372
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:01,100
Ian Quinn.
I'm your last-minute party crasher.

373
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:05,839
- Skye.
- Oh. Wow.

374
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:08,041
Great to meet you.

375
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:10,109
Um, this is Skye, a
member of the Rising Tide.

376
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:12,011
<i>They're a group of hackers.</i>

377
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:14,047
I've gotten some pretty big
secrets out to the public.

378
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:17,049
I prefer "hacktivist."
I'm glad you've heard of our site.

379
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,118
I read it. We think very much alike ...
more freedom of information,

380
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:21,987
less government infringing
on everyone's rights ...

381
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,722
- I'm a fan.
- That explains the invite.

382
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:26,224
This is a tough party to get into.

383
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:28,694
Not as hard to get into as
the encrypted back channel

384
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:30,896
you contacted us through
to request the invite.

385
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:33,300
That's sort of where I live.

386
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:34,866
You've got to show me
how you did that ...

387
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,203
- I mean, if you sign on.
- Sign what, now?

388
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:42,920
I've been known to turn a few
black hats into white hats,

389
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:45,743
not just for vulnerability analysis,
but for very creative thinking.

390
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,512
A-are you offering me a job?

391
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,514
Well, I didn't invite you
here for your pretty face.

392
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:53,049
I didn't know you had a pretty face.

393
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,620
Yes, I want to hire you before
someone else snatches you up.

394
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:58,555
<i> That seemed to go well.</i>

395
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,992
Yeah. It did.

396
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:07,497
<i>Many of you shareholders
have been with us for years,</i>

397
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,398
<i>and I see a few new names here,</i>

398
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:12,267
<i>but I want to thank you
all for traveling so far</i>

399
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:13,936
<i>to this beautiful country</i>

400
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:17,039
<i>and, well, for slumming
it at Shaba Tal-Banar.</i>

401
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,010
<i>This country where we are allowed</i>

402
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:23,312
<i>to pursue progress and profit</i>

403
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:26,548
<i>without the stranglehold of regulations</i>

404
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:28,984
<i>that are now choking our world.</i>

405
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,921
<i>The United States government,
the R.U., the DRTC,</i>

406
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,857
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. ...
these are just a few of the institutions</i>

407
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:39,360
<i>that are guilty of halting the
development of new technology</i>

408
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:42,363
<i>for anyone ...
except themselves.</i>

409
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,133
<i>We dare defy them with a new idea,</i>

410
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,636
<i>they steal in and sweep
it out from under us.</i>

411
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,471
<i>But not today.</i>

412
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,140
<i>You're all aware of what Quinn
worldwide has been able to do</i>

413
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,809
<i>with basic minerals, let
alone uranium or plutonium,</i>

414
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:59,346
<i>despite these unjust restrictions</i>

415
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,715
<i>that weigh the scales
in the other guy's favor.</i>

416
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,919
<i>Well, today, I'm
announcing something new ...</i>

417
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:09,055
<i>an element that could
balance those scales,</i>

418
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,290
<i>and I mean that quite literally.</i>

419
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:14,260
<i>Imagine if you could control gravity,</i>

420
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:18,431
<i>if instead of drilling for
oil, it rose up to greet you.</i>

421
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:21,300
<i>Imagine if you could move a
super tanker's worth of cargo</i>

422
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,668
<i>with a swipe of your hand.</i>

423
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:26,533
<i>Well, we will do this and more.</i>

424
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,673
<i>This could have been a
traumatic experience for Dr. Hall.</i>

425
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:32,210
He may not be the same when we
find him, Ward. I'll talk him down.

426
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:34,579
We don't want your
personality to set him on edge.

427
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,114
Great time for humor, sir.

428
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:39,951
My people skills are the least of
our problems if Skye can't get us in.

429
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:52,429
- It's locked, but there's no lock.
- Eh, check for a keypad.

430
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,835
Nothing.
What, you can hack a keypad?

431
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,105
- No, not over the phone.
- Is there a reception desk?

432
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:03,940
Okay, yeah.

433
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:07,544
Well, now what do I do?

434
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:12,015
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

435
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:16,486
Just... looking for a pen.
Here we go.

436
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,522
Got to write down all those
good ideas, you know what I mean?

437
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,357
Of course you know what I mean.

438
00:25:21,391 --> 00:25:23,892
Probably have like
10 pens for all your ideas.

439
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:26,496
What are you really doing?

440
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,985
All right.
I'm busted.

441
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,369
<i>I was trying to get a glimpse
behind your office doors,</i>

442
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:35,570
see how things really operate.

443
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:37,405
I invite you here as a guest,

444
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,041
you treat me like another
corrupt institution,

445
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,577
looking for trade
secrets to leak online.

446
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,721
- Security.
- No, no, no, wait.

447
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,014
It's just, with all
these la-di-da people,

448
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:50,518
you have to be so guarded,
so careful ...

449
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:56,257
<i>What you say, what secrets you reveal.</i>

450
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:02,295
And...
I was hoping that you and I...

451
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,554
could be honest with one another.

452
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,350
If you know what I mean.

453
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,330
{...}

454
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,281
<i> Wow, that's a less space, more wheels. </i>

455
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:29,851
<i>- Wow, a view of the ocean and the pool.
- Not a bad place to do business.</i>

456
00:26:29,886 --> 00:26:32,821
Got the e spatch leaking Hall's
location. User's an alias.

457
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,722
Oh, can you trace the DHCP server ...

458
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,857
Trace is running, but
it'll take time. Our girl?

459
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,260
I thought she was done for,
but she's just sweet-talked

460
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:41,762
- her way into Quinn's office.
- How'd she manage that?

461
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:44,231
- Pbht!
- She probably just used her, um...

462
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:48,797
uh...uh...
her, uh... ah, boobs.

463
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:51,422
Ugh. That's the only explana...

464
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,840
<i>Oh my gosh. It seems it goes...</i>

465
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:55,275
Dead!
Fitz!

466
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,345
- What ... I didn't. She must've ...
- Oh, lord.

467
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,984
<i>Much better.</i>

468
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:07,053
Haven't felt that "someone's
watching my every move" feeling

469
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,754
since I failed my driver's test.

470
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:11,089
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

471
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,892
- S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you?
- They picked me up in L.A.,

472
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:17,530
I helped them in a crisis,
and now they want to recruit me.

473
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:18,997
Of course they did.

474
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:22,100
So I played along.
Talk about inside info ...

475
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:25,870
I have a bunk on their plane.
I've been gathering intel,

476
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:28,707
biding my time until
I could become useful.

477
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:30,542
I thought this qualified.

478
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:33,878
Why would they trust you with
a covert operation like this?

479
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:36,815
Something about S.H.I.E.L.D.
not breaking international laws.

480
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:40,571
They had no other options, whereas

481
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,053
I like to keep mine open.

482
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,734
Next patrol any minute now.

483
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:01,403
<i> Skye's offline.
Repeat, we've lost audio and vitals.</i>

484
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:03,805
Abort is not an option, but
if she's compromising ...

485
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,807
She's still our only way
in to get to Dr. Hall.

486
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:07,142
And we're their only way out.

487
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:11,947
<i>Beach is all clear.
Let's move up the ridge.</i>

488
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:15,351
You're saying they wanted to rope me
in because I pose a genuine threat.

489
00:28:15,385 --> 00:28:18,552
- Yes, and fit their profile.
- Profile.

490
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,856
Sure. You're a criminal.
You have a warrant somewhere.

491
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:24,025
- Probably.
- Specialized skill set.

492
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,096
- I try to stay humble but fail.
- No family.

493
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,401
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hit a nerve,

494
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:36,703
but that is what these people do.

495
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:39,006
S.H.I.E.L.D. ... they prey on fear

496
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,343
<i>and loneliness and desperation,
and then they offer a home</i>

497
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:46,313
to those who have no
one else to turn to.

498
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:50,849
<i>I can offer you something better.</i>

499
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:06,164
Damn.
A little rusty, I guess.

500
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,236
Guys, clock's ticking.
Where's Skye?

501
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,505
<i>You stay with us, there's no secrets,
no lies, and no agenda.</i>

502
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,375
You're free to do what you do

503
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,610
without big brother watching over you.

504
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,414
But first, you have to tell me

505
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:27,051
exactly what agenda S.H.I.E.L.D.
sent you in here with.

506
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:32,889
Well, they wanted me to do
whatever it takes to get in here.

507
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:38,694
Get in here and...?

508
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:48,004
Bat my eyes.
Get you talking.

509
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,905
- We're in!
- She's done it!

510
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,442
- Fitz, you're up.
- Oh, mother of all things.

511
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:56,345
Move, move, move!
Uh...

512
00:29:56,379 --> 00:30:00,015
<i> We have a man down.
Hostiles on the east ridge!</i>

513
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,519
Aah!
We need a reset here, Fitz!

514
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,956
Fitz!

515
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,058
Saying his name repeatedly
does not increase productivity!

516
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:12,827
- Okay, go!
- Oh, maybe it does.

517
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:17,331
<i>System rebooting in two, one, now!</i>

518
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,842
- I'll look for Dr. Hall down in the lab.
- I'll get Skye.

519
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,312
<i>No, you can't be the only angle.</i>

520
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:35,516
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s thorough enough
to know about me and my exploits.

521
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,619
It takes more than a
pretty face to disarm me.

522
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,888
Sir, we have a security breach.

523
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,422
Oh, the timing on that was perfect.

524
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:58,004
Dr. Hall. Agent Coulson.
We have an exit strategy.

525
00:30:58,038 --> 00:30:59,438
- S.H.I.E.L.D.?
- Yes, sir.

526
00:30:59,472 --> 00:31:01,940
- Let's get you out of here.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Coulson.

527
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:06,611
- I'm right where I'm supposed to be.
- I'll be honest,

528
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:10,449
our strategy did not take into
consideration you saying that.

529
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,021
Oh, no.

530
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,956
Look, I don't know what Quinn
is promising you, but ...

531
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,091
An opportunity.

532
00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:26,631
We can't let Quinn have control of this.
It's too dangerous.

533
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,400
We can't let anyone have control
of this. That's why I'm here ...

534
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:33,137
To bury it at the bottom
of the ocean, with him.

535
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:39,709
<i> Coulson.
The leak came from ...</i>

536
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:41,411
Dr. Hall.
Yeah, I'm getting that.

537
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:45,149
All petitions, embargoes in
the world couldn't stop Ian.

538
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,583
He grows more powerful every day.

539
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:50,519
And then I get word he's found this.

540
00:31:55,258 --> 00:32:00,129
I'm sorry, Mr. Coulson.
I had to make a choice.

541
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,959
<i>Something tells me that
wasn't the "off" button!</i>

542
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:19,892
- Guys, we need to talk.
- Lost you for a minute.

543
00:32:19,926 --> 00:32:24,029
- We're aware of the problem, sir.
- Hall wanted Quinn to kidnap him?

544
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,365
- Yeah, why would he do that?
- What is wrong with him?

545
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,301
Quinn built a gravity generator,
like the one we found but bigger.

546
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:33,372
Hall knew Quinn would need
him to control its raw power,

547
00:32:33,406 --> 00:32:35,474
but Hall just wanted to unleash it.

548
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:38,209
The one we found was 2.5
centimeters in diameter.

549
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:40,778
It stopped a semi.
How big are we talking?

550
00:32:40,812 --> 00:32:43,947
12 feet. It'll definitely
take down the entire compound.

551
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:45,949
- It'll sink the place.
- No, it'll do more than that.

552
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:49,820
Work a solution. I'll disconnect
the power before things get...

553
00:32:49,855 --> 00:32:52,790
<i>crazy.</i>

554
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:58,127
They can't help you.

555
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:07,003
Soon, it'll reach an
exponential acceleration state.

556
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,040
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:19,481
- My team's here ... good people.
- Sworn to protect all mankind?

558
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,918
That's what I'm doing, I promise ...

559
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:24,420
making things right.

560
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,199
Don't you get it?

561
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,068
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s against
everything you stand for.

562
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,805
- They're big brother.
- Maybe, but they're the nice big brother

563
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,140
who stands up for his
helpless little brother

564
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:48,408
when he's getting beat up

565
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,778
because he ate a piece
of cake that he wasn't ...

566
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:54,213
you know, you kidnapped a person!

567
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:56,917
<i>I set him free! I saved him!</i>

568
00:33:57,951 --> 00:34:03,456
- And I could've saved you.
- This place is massive.

569
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,724
<i>- Where am I heading?
- Southwest corner.</i>

570
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,392
<i>Ward, tell me you've got
things covered on the ground.</i>

571
00:34:08,427 --> 00:34:10,595
I can't do a damn thing from out here.

572
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:12,363
I'm working on it.

573
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:17,569
Tell me what they're doing!

574
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:22,539
Tell me what they're doing.
You have to talk.

575
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,075
You have no other way out of this.

576
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:27,911
You're expendable to S.H.I.E.L.D.

577
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:30,113
they sent you in here with nothing.

578
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:32,816
Ah!

579
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:36,620
- They taught me a few things.
- Kid's got balls.

580
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:39,622
Thanks, but... yuck.

581
00:34:39,656 --> 00:34:42,959
But do you have what it
takes to pull the trigger?

582
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,862
Nope.

583
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:52,935
Get her.

584
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:07,448
Hall.
We have to evacuate.

585
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,885
Get the chopper. Now!

586
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:20,528
<i>All I had to do to get
access to Quinn's lab</i>

587
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:25,098
was drop little clues, create
a puzzle for him to solve.

588
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,768
- Quinn likes to feel smart.
- So you leaked your location.

589
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:32,204
- Why not try reasoning with him?
- You can't reason with an addict,

590
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,674
and he's addicted to
exploiting opportunities.

591
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:39,278
<i>He never gives a thought
to the friends, ecosystems,</i>

592
00:35:39,312 --> 00:35:41,948
future generations
left ruined in his wake.

593
00:35:41,982 --> 00:35:44,950
Like Agents Fitz and
Simmons, your former students?

594
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:48,554
I've got them in my ear right now,
telling me you're not a bad guy.

595
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:50,522
We could've worked with you on this.

596
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:56,227
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D.?</i>

597
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:58,963
S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as
guilty of the same thing!

598
00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:02,567
Experimentation without
thought of consequence!

599
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:05,736
Your search for an
unlimited power source

600
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:09,874
- brought an alien invasion.
- Fair point.

601
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,847
T-this element is far too powerful
for you, for him, for anyone!

602
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:20,416
<i>I don't have to tell you that.</i>

603
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:21,551
You're feeling it now.

604
00:36:40,904 --> 00:36:41,904
<i>- Get her!
- Come here...</i>

605
00:36:41,905 --> 00:36:43,472
No, no. No, no!
Please, please!

606
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:05,459
Are you hurt?

607
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:08,762
Just follow my orders.
I'll get us out of here.

608
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:25,545
<i>I see the future, Mr. Coulson,
and it's a catastrophe.</i>

609
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,114
I just see a lot of people in trouble.

610
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:32,485
Nothing. Fitz-Simmons?

611
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,087
<i>I tried to cut the power.
It's still going.</i>

612
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,755
- Find a catalyst.
- You need to find a catalyst.

613
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,224
Something to create a
chemical reaction in the core.

614
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,926
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Help me find a catalyst ...

615
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:45,897
I am doing the right thing ...
a completely selfless act.

616
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:49,401
<i>I know that history never
celebrates what didn't happen.</i>

617
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,302
They'll call this a-a tragedy.

618
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,904
<i>They won't understand
the good I did here.</i>

619
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:59,277
- Killing innocent people?
- Saving millions.

620
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:02,513
We have to live with
the choices we make,

621
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:05,949
but sometimes we have
to die with them, too.

622
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,885
I understand.

623
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:14,123
- You made a hard call.
- Yes.

624
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,660
And now I have to make mine.

625
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:58,565
<i>- Say it back to me.
- Deepest level of the fridge,</i>

626
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,500
<i>unmarked vault, no access granted.</i>

627
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,603
And no recorded entry.
I don't want it listed.

628
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:04,538
I don't want it flagged
for the slingshot.

629
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:08,508
Anyone finds out, you're
responsible ...  and suffering.

630
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,677
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

631
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:14,180
That's what Hall would've wanted.

632
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:17,650
Used to have this down.

633
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:23,056
- Should be just muscle memory.
- You're making a habit of it, sir.

634
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,160
Trying.
Guess I'm a little rusty.

635
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:31,496
Of these close calls, I mean.
I don't enjoy running back end.

636
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,634
You want off the plane?
Go ahead.

637
00:39:37,771 --> 00:39:39,004
I want in.

638
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:43,608
Reporting for combat next time it's up.

639
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:48,045
You committed to the cause
or just watching my back?

640
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,548
Same thing.

641
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,159
And you are a little rusty.

642
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:17,940
You and your brothers...
where'd you grow up?

643
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,210
Massachusetts, mostly.

644
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:27,249
- A house?
- You didn't?

645
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,385
One house.

646
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:35,156
The Brodys.

647
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:46,100
I was 9. Sent me back to
St. Agnes after a month.

648
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:51,404
- Said I wasn't a good fit.
- Foster parents.

649
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:57,444
- Your first?
- My third.

650
00:40:57,478 --> 00:41:03,150
I had heard it before, but...
this one was different.

651
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:06,774
'Cause you wanted them to like you.

652
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:10,957
Bad.

653
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:19,498
I called her "mom" once...

654
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,766
tried it out.

655
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,603
Guess it wasn't a good fit.

656
00:41:30,977 --> 00:41:33,544
Hoping for something and losing it

657
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,646
hurts more than never
hoping for anything.

658
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:43,087
- We won't turn our back.
- Doesn't matter.

659
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:46,891
I made my choice.
